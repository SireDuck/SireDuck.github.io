Welcome to my personal website. Here you can find most of my academic projects (finished or in progress) and some information about me. I'm currently a second year Ph.D. student at UConn working with [Dr. Ambar Sengupta](https://math.uconn.edu/person/ambar-sengupta/). In 2023, I graduated with a B.A. in mathematics and physics from CU Boulder, with honors in mathematics. You can find my senior project here (link). Outside of academia, I enjoy cooking, hiking, and playing video games. I also really enjoy eating out and trying new foods, especially with other people.

Interests
======
I am generally interested in differential topology and mathematical physics. I have studied various mathematical quantization schemes (e.g. [deformation quantization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_quantization)) in the past, and plan to continue in related areas. In terms of pure math, I'm interested in symplectic/Poisson geometry, (co-)homology theory, and more recently diffeological spaces. I have also enjoyed studying topoi, sheaves, and general category theory on the side.
