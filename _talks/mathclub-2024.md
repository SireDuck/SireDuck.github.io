I presented a version of deformation quantization for undergraduates at UConn's math club. The purpose of this presentation is to introduce the harmonic oscillator in classical mechanics and standard quantum mechanics, and then present a star-product technique from deformation quantization that recovers the energy levels of the quantum harmonic oscillator.

Abstract
------
A new mathematical description of a physical theory should be consistent with an earlier description of the theory in settings where the earlier one has been well-tested by experiments. This often means that the earlier mathematical description is a limiting case of the new one at certain parameter values or that the new description is a “deformation” of the old one.

As a prototypical example, the ancient idea of a flat Earth is a limiting case of the  more accurate sphere model when we look at a sphere up close. We also can interpret quantum mechanics as a deformation of classical mechanics via a mathematical technique called “deformation quantization.” Here, quantum mechanics involves Planck’s constant $\hbar$ and its limiting behavior as $\hbar \to 0$ leads us back to classical mechanics. This talk will give an introduction to what deformation quantization is all about.

The talk will assume the audience has seen partial derivatives and eigenvalues.
